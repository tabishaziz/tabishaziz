About Me:

Hey, I'm Tabish Aziz, a high school student born and raised in the mountainous valley of Gilgit, Pakistan. I bought my first computer at the age of 8. I was always interested in playing with the computer's User-interface, which later developed into an interest in computer science and software development. I am pursuing computer science as a career and I wish to provide solutions to the rapidly growing world through, creativity and innovation.

What I Do:

I love the process of crafting code and solving problems. Whether it's building small projects, optimizing algorithms, or learning new programming languages and frameworks, I'm always eager to expand my knowledge and skills. I find joy in unraveling complex problems and developing elegant solutions.

Projects :

Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

1. AKUEB Practicals for HSSC II
2. Practice Code for Learning
3. AKUEB Computer Science for HSSC II
4. 2D Game Development : (Chess, Mine sweeper, Soduku, etc.)
   
Feel free to check out my repositories for more!

Interests:

Apart from coding, I have a deep interest in mathematics and physics. I'm captivated by the beauty of mathematical concepts and the way they manifest in the physical world and help us reach complex and much needed conclusions. This fascination has not only influenced my approach to problem-solving but also sparked my curiosity in the realm of computer science.

Get in touch :

I'm always open to new opportunities, collaborations, and discussions. Whether you want to work on a project together, share coding tips, or just chat about technology and science, feel free to reach out to me. Let's connect and explore the endless possibilities of software!
