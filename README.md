About Me
Hey, I'm Tabish Aziz, a high school student from AKHSS Gilgit, currently in grade 12th. I've always been passionate about computers and technology since my early years, and that led me to dive into the world of programming. I started my journey with C++, Python, and C, and I've been exploring various aspects of software development ever since.

What I Do
I love the process of crafting code and solving problems. Whether it's building small projects, optimizing algorithms, or learning new programming languages and frameworks, I'm always eager to expand my knowledge and skills. I find joy in unraveling complex problems and developing elegant solutions.

Projects
Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

Project 1: 
Project 2: 
Project 3: 
Feel free to check out my repositories for more!

Interests
Apart from coding, I have a deep interest in mathematics and physics. I'm captivated by the beauty of mathematical concepts and the way they manifest in the physical world. This fascination has not only influenced my approach to problem-solving but also sparked my curiosity in the realm of computer science.

Get in Touch
I'm always open to new opportunities, collaborations, and discussions. Whether you want to work on a project together, share coding tips, or just chat about technology and science, feel free to reach out to me. Let's connect and explore the endless possibilities of software!
