# üí´ About Me:
Nestled among the breathtaking peaks of Gilgit, Pakistan, you'll find me, Tabish Aziz ‚Äì a coding enthusiast whose journey began with a computer at the age of 8. What started as playful tinkering with its interface blossomed into a full-blown love affair with technology.

But I'm not your average coder; I'm on a mission to infuse warmth and creativity into every line of code I write. With a smile on my face and a spark in my heart, I'm determined to stand out from the crowd and make a difference in the world. As Steve Jobs famously said, "Innovation is what distinguishes a leader from a follower," and I'm all about leading with innovation and a friendly touch.

<!-- Interests Section -->
## Interests

Apart from coding, I have a deep interest in mathematics and physics. I'm captivated by the beauty of mathematical concepts and the way they manifest in the physical world and help us reach complex and much-needed conclusions. This fascination has not only influenced my approach to problem-solving but also sparked my curiosity in the realm of computer science.

<!-- About Me Section -->
## About Me

Hey, I'm Tabish Aziz, a high school student born and raised in the mountainous valley of Gilgit, Pakistan. I bought my first computer at the age of 8. I was always interested in playing with the computer's User-interface, which later developed into an interest in computer science and software development. I am pursuing computer science as a career and I wish to provide solutions to the rapidly growing world through creativity and innovation.
