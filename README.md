<!-- About Me Section -->
## About Me

Hey, I'm Tabish Aziz, a high school student born and raised in the mountainous valley of Gilgit, Pakistan. I bought my first computer at the age of 8. I was always interested in playing with the computer's User-interface, which later developed into an interest in computer science and software development. I am pursuing computer science as a career and I wish to provide solutions to the rapidly growing world through creativity and innovation.

<!-- Projects Section -->
## Projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

1. AKUEB Practicals for HSSC II
2. Practice Code for Learning
3. AKUEB Computer Science for HSSC II
4. 2D Game Development: (Chess, Mine sweeper, Sudoku, etc.)
   
Feel free to check out my repositories for more!

<!-- Interests Section -->
## Interests

Apart from coding, I have a deep interest in mathematics and physics. I'm captivated by the beauty of mathematical concepts and the way they manifest in the physical world and help us reach complex and much-needed conclusions. This fascination has not only influenced my approach to problem-solving but also sparked my curiosity in the realm of computer science.

<!-- Get in Touch Section -->
## Get in Touch

I'm always open to new opportunities, collaborations, and discussions. Whether you want to work on a project together, share coding tips, or just chat about technology and science, feel free to reach out to me. Let's connect and explore the endless possibilities of software!
