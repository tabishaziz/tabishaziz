## About Me

Hey, I'm Tabish Aziz, a high school student born and raised in the mountainous valley of Gilgit, Pakistan. I've been fascinated by computers since a young age, and my curiosity led me to explore the world of programming. I'm passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems and improve lives.

## What I Do

I love the process of crafting code and solving problems. Whether it's building small projects, optimizing algorithms, or learning new programming languages and frameworks, I'm always eager to expand my knowledge and skills. I find joy in unraveling complex problems and developing elegant solutions.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

1. **AKUEB Practicals for HSSC II**
2. **Practice Code for Learning**
3. **AKUEB Computer Science for HSSC II**
4. **2D Game Development**: Chess, Minesweeper, Sudoku, etc.

Feel free to check out my repositories for more!

## Interests

Apart from coding, I have a deep interest in mathematics and physics. I'm captivated by the beauty of mathematical concepts and the way they manifest in the physical world. This fascination has not only influenced my approach to problem-solving but also sparked my curiosity in the realm of computer science.

## Get in Touch

I'm always open to new opportunities, collaborations, and discussions. Whether you want to work on a project together, share coding tips, or just chat about technology and science, feel free to reach out to me. Let's connect and explore the endless possibilities of software!
